    <h2>WHAT IS A CHEESE CRISP?</h2>
    <p>
        The Arizona cheese crisp, also known as “Sonoran Quesadilla”, is said to have originated in Southern Arizona as a way to use leftover flour tortillas. It is a popular Mexican-style dish all over Arizona and surrounding areas, although it’s not necessarily a traditional dish.

        A cheese crisp is basically a flat tortilla covered with piles of cheese. It is then baked in the oven until the cheese has melted and the tortilla has a perfectly crisp texture.

        It is similar to a Quesadilla, except that a quesadilla is folded over and pan-fried until toasted and warm throughout.
